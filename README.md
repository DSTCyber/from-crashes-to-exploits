# From Crashes to Exploits ... or how to hack libpng

This is a presentation that we developed (aimed at undergraduate students) on
taking a crash found by [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/), debugging it
and turning it into a working exploit. It is a **very** introductory look at
exploit development and focuses on the most simplest of buffer overflows.
However, it is based on real vulnerability:
[CVE-2004-0597](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2004-0597/).

## What's included

* Presentation slides
* Vulnerable PNG parser
* AFL crashes
* Shellcode example
